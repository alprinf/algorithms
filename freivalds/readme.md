# Freivald's algorithm
 - Given n by n matrices A, B, and C, ```class Freivald``` verifies whether AB = C using Freivald's algorithm.
 - Input file is ```.txt``` which contains n, A, B, C.
 
Run following command to get verification result:

    python freivald.py verify_freivald "file path"

Output will be "Yes" if AB = C, "No" if AB !=C.
